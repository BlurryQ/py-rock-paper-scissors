# Rock Paper Scissors (in Python)

![Rock Paper Scissors Screenshot](./demo.png)

## Summary

To practice my Python skills, I created a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The game includes an error handling loop at the beginning to ensure a valid integer is entered for the number of wins required to declare a winner. It then prompts the user for their choice in each round, selects a random choice for the computer, and continues until a winner is declared.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Encapsulation**: All code is organized within function scopes to prevent unauthorized alteration of variables. This approach protects the integrity of the game's internal logic and facilitates modular programming.

- **Error Handling**: If the user fails to enter a valid number of wins to play for, they are informed and prompted to input it again. This ensures a smooth user experience by guiding them through proper input.
