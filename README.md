# Rock Paper Scissors (in Python)

A fun game to practice my Python :D

## Skills Shown

**Encapsulation** I ensure that no one can alter any variables I have set by placing all code within function scopes. This protects the integrity of the game's internal logic and allows for modular programming.

**Error Handling** If a user doesn't enter the number of wins to play for correctly, the user will be informed and asked for the input again. This ensures a smooth user experience by guiding them through proper input.

## Set Up

You will need to install inquirer by doing the follow in terminal.

```
pip install inquirer
```
